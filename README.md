# Body Mass Index calculator

Another code challenge from [Frontend Mentor](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/body-mass-index-calculator-brrBkfSz1T). It's a premium one so no access to designs/starter files so I improvised.

## Brief

Your challenge is to build out this body mass index calculator page and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

You can use any tools you like to help you complete the challenge. So if you've got something you'd like to practice, feel free to give it a go.

Your users should be able to:

- Select whether they want to use metric or imperial units
- Enter their height and weight
- See their BMI result, with their weight classification and healthy weight range
- View the optimal layout for the interface depending on their device's screen size
- See hover and focus states for all interactive elements on the page
